              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Throughout the months of October and November, we have continued our weekly outreach events with Learning Bee, Friends of Children with Special Needs (FCSN), and the Fremont Unified School District (FUSD) Special Needs Program. The students’ knowledge of computer science and coding has definitely grown over the last few weeks, as well as their interest in the topic! Although online sessions are definitely not the preferred situation of both teaching and learning, both our students and teachers have become more accustomed and are more comfortable with the distance learning Scratch courses.
              </p>

              <h3>Games and Advanced Concepts</h3>
              <p>
                As much as we hope our students are enjoying our weekly classes, we also try to make sure that they understand and are learning the concepts we teach them through the games they build. We aim to make the classes as fun and engaging as possible while delivering important information. And even though all of those concepts aren’t always retained in the students’ memories, we hope that by giving them the opportunity to be exposed to this knowledge and the fundamental computer science concepts we try to teach, it will help them improve at a faster rate in the future. Coding and computer science are such fast-growing and vast areas and especially with us living in Silicon Valley, it’s an important and helpful skill to learn.
              </p>

              <h3>Winter Showcase</h3>
              <p>
                Beginning in November, our students have started working on their projects for the Winter Showcase. These projects are cumulative and will be completed over the course of a few weeks in preparation for the end-of-the-year event, happening on December 15th and 18th. With these projects, the students have more creative freedom to design their projects based on their interests and to explore computer science on the MIT Scratch platform. It’s fascinating to see the students use what they’ve learned in past sessions to create their final projects, although it has been quite a journey switching from our accustomed in-person experience, we do not regret it a bit. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The LB Scratch students have been working on two different projects, based on their skill level, experience, and knowledge. The beginner and intermediate students have been working on an adventure game that can be described as a visual version of the text-based game “Adventure” that was released in 1976. The advanced group of students is building a platformer-type adventure game where their characters, based on the popular game Among Us, travel through portals and jump over obstacles to reach the finish line. Both of the games in the curriculum for the Winter Showcase, created by some of our teachers Kyle and Divya, allow students to choose their characters and settings and helps them use their past coding knowledge in new, more imaginative ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our special-ed students have also been working on projects for the winter showcase! During our FCSN and FUSD weekly classes, they have been working on an “All About Me” type of project in Scratch, which they can easily customize and share at our Winter Showcase. For our non-verbal students, we have also created an auto-generating “All About Me” project using the Amazon Web Service plugin to Scratch. We’re excited to see what all of our students create! If you’re interested in joining us at the Winter Showcase, check out the flyer and information <a href = "winter-showcase.html">here</a>.

              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
              <p>
                In the coming weeks, our teachers and students will continue to prepare for the approaching Winter Showcase! It’ll definitely be a hectic few weeks though, with the semester coming to a close and winter break coming up for our students, and finals and robotics competitions coming up for our teachers. We intend to spend the next few class sessions helping our students finish up their projects and get ready to present them virtually to the parents, teachers, and students attending. We cannot wait to continue sharing our passion in the new year and are excited for the new year, where Serendipity plans to come back stronger than ever!
